# Giphy Front End Homework

Front End coding challenge.

## Project

We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).
Users visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see a list of results. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

This project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:

- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.
- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.
- Show off your animation skills!
- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.
- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.
- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetching… could be optimized for UX.
- Let the user upload a GIF.
- Add some unit tests.
